# opensea bid bot
Opensource opensea bid bot.
Proxies are not required (but recommended if speed is what you are looking for).

### main features

- multi rpc support
- multi wallet support
- proxy option (avoid opensea ratelimit)


### configuration

OS bid bot requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.
You will also need an [infura.io](https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum) account for the RPC provider.

Note: The bot will start a thread for every mnemonic/privatekey. This means that you can have more of the same mnemonic/privatekey in your config so it starts more threads, resulting in a faster bot.

Edit the `config.json` file to your needs.

`rpc_urls` -> an array of rpc providers (one or more)<br>
`mnemonics` -> an array of mnemonics<br>
`privateKeys` -> an array of private keys<br>
`bid_price` -> amount of `WETH` you want to bid on the assets<br>
`expiration` -> amount of hours in which you want your offer/bid to expire<br>
`timeout` -> timeout in `ms` per bid<br>
`proxied` -> boolean `false`/`true` . if `true`, will read proxies from `proxies.txt`<br>
`targets` -> array of targets with the `address` and `supply` of the collection. the `address` can be found in the url when visiting an asset from this collection; `https://opensea.io/assets/<COLLECTION_ADDRESS>/<token_id (not relevant)>`. the `supply` is the amount of tokens in existence.

##### Always have either one private key or mnemonic !!!
